I’ve acquired much of the skills that ITP teaches– programming, physical computing, graphics, and video editing– but 3D continues to be beyond me. Consequently, my attempt at this week’s Subtraction assignment will probably be less impressive than those of my classmates’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off intending to make a panda bear. A simple enough project, and one that worked well enough for me in 2D space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_mill2/vw1.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_mill2/vw1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_mill2/vw2.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_mill2/vw2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I rendered the STL in MakerBot, it was quite clear that I didn’t know what I was doing. I could take down the arms after milling, but that seems to me a waste of using a mill if I had to whittle afterwards. My impression is that Vectorworks is really great if you want precision and generally flat surfaces, but it’s beyond my ability to make rounded shapes. I decided instead to mill a bunch of columns. I liked the idea that a miniature person might find a log and carve a building out of it. Maybe using columns and pillars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_mill2/vw3.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_mill2/vw3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, I wanted to make something without tabs and to retain the material around the milled area. It seemed like a good fit, and easily rendered using Vectorworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_mill2/mill1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_mill2/mill1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I snuck onto the machine on Saturday, and then setup my job. As mentioned, I didn’t need tabs, but I had to adjust the job to give it margins on the sides. I also used Softwood instead of Hardwood this time– it produced a lot of tearout, but there was a huge time difference between the two settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_mill2/mill2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_mill2/mill2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then cut and sanded it down, and applied a quick finish. Cute little columns.&lt;/p&gt;

A smart contract protects their rights to be paid when it works, but if it is attacked by a hacker nobody is protected unless they are rich. Consequentially, I wanted to work with smart contracts with people who had disposable incomes– for whom an attack would not mean loss of livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is the fail story: the Finance group failed to meet up this week– we couldn’t coordinate all four schedules, but we were able to meet for a few different (four of them!) meetings with subsets of the group. Unfortunately, we never came to an idea, but since I don’t like to fail to blog, here’s an idea that I had on my own-ish:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem: a number of fundraising events ask for a donation contingent on reaching some kind of goal. This includes things like marathons and donation matching. These events ask for a commitment, but they may not reach their goals. This can result in wasted resources like investment in running vests for runners who never run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location: NYC (or whole of NA)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interview Plan: (one on one interviews)
- Marathon runners (x2)
- Charity run organizers (e.g. the London marathon had many defaultees) (x3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions:
- Why do you like to run marathons?
- Do you regularly donate to charity otherwise?
- What resources do you expect to help you fundraise for your place in a marathon?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rita Cheng</name><email>rita@ritacheng.com</email></author><category term="doing good is good business" /><category term="unicef" /><category term="good business" /><category term="finance" /><summary>I am uncomfortable with the idea of using smart contracts with the underprivileged in the US; one of the virtues of them is that they are not strongly regulated by the government, but that is also problematic when they are not guaranteed to be secure.

I came to this topic after a long deliberation. When I read that we were to tap into unconscious, subconscious, and the collective, my thoughts turned immediately to the latent biases everyone has. But there are many datasets I could’ve used, and many biases that could be examined– I eventually settled on movies because it’s a topic I know very well, and whose history of sexism has been well documented. It’s also a topic that’s been studied before: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/index.html&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; looked at how much dialogue different genders have on screen, and Russ Putman maintains a fantastic twitter with female script intros &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/femscriptintros?lang=en&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to see if I could generate the sexist introductions of the kind that Mr. Putman has documented thoroughly, using a dataset culled from famous movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by downloading a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlds.soe.ucsc.edu/fc2&quot;&gt;dataset I found from UC Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, which is culled from the Internet Movie Script Database (imsdb.com). I then wrote a ruby script to find every sentence that surrounded certian keywords. Here, I look for sentences that contain the word ‘sexy’:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.open('corpus.txt', 'w') do |writer| 
  Dir.glob('imsdb_scenes_dialogs_nov_2015/scenes/**/*').each do |file|
    next unless File.file?(file)
    content = File.read(file)
    content.scan(/.*sexy .*/) do |match|
      writer.write match
      writer.write &quot;\n&quot;
    end
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could’ve saved all of my keywords in one file, but I wanted to inspect each keyword individually to see if I should use it. Some words were more fruitful than others. For instance, I started looking at ‘pretty’, ‘beautiful’, and other variations on that word:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She looks up. She is beautiful and terrified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Points to a gorgeous dead woman with the word GRIFTER on her stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But besides examples like those, I also turned up a lot of uses to describe environments and scenery. That wouldn’t do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then looked at hair colours, noticing a pattern in which women were consistently described by their hair. (For anybody who’s taken a screenwriting class, this is apparently a terrible practice, but it’s been very successful with these produced and famous scripts.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TAMARA, 28, blonde, wears the shortest mini one can imagine,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We barely notice the redhead kneeling between his legs, face buried in his crotch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that too many instances of ‘blonde’, despite being gendered, were for men; same goes for redheads. The corpus can include false positives, but not nearly as many as there were for these words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then switched to looking at ‘sexy’ and ‘naked’ and ‘nude’. These were generally great– even when they described men, they were typically sexualized. These were part of the corpus that I eventually settled on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;She’s naked but for the tiny silver crucifix she wears around her neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;MODEL, lying nude in a pool of blue paint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Go boards, pachinko machines, sexy little MANGA WAIFS in schoolgirl outfits doling out drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, here are a few of my favourite quotes that my little website has generated. It’s only a Markov chain– it would’ve likely worked out better if I created a ruleset. I like the unpredictability of it, though, and creating a ruleset for sexism would’ve been emotionally exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;

The metal lathe was admittedly a bit intimidating, but I had wanted to try it. Oh well! This week, we tackled the 4-Axis mill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of this week’s exercise was working with Vectorworks– my background in no way involves 3D modelling so I had no idea how to work with this software. Photoshop and Illustrator? Fine. But add another dimension and I’m lost. I had to try hard not to compare myself to other people in the class– they have backgrounds in industrial design, I tell myself, so they knew how to model already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided that I wanted to make myself a simple, geometric necklace. It took a while to figure out Vectorworks’ interpretation of “extruding”, but I eventually settled on the folowing shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_4axis/vectorworks.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_4axis/vectorworks.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I couldn’t quite remember all the steps for setting up the mill, and had to ask Eric for help. He was a great help, but admittedly all I didn’t remember was that I needed an allen key to move the tail stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_4axis/setup.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_4axis/setup.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cut out job took a bit under an hour. Eric had advised me to use a lot of tabs (because he hadn’t, and his project snapped) so it’s a bit bulky and needs to be sanded down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_4axis/cutout.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_4axis/cutout.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my immense regret, though, I cut the thing out without first drilling the hole– so I had to clamp it to drill the hole. After I did so, though, the bottom part snapped off– which isn’t too regrettable, since it still looks more or less like I did so intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I finished sanding it down, I took some yarn from the soft lab and threaded it through. It’s alright for a first try at the mill!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of being unbanked affects 2 billion people in the world, the impact of which is that they have no access to credit, insurance, savings, and payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compelling-stories&quot;&gt;Compelling Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the following links about un/underbanked American families– I hope that my teammates find sources on non-American sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/&quot;&gt;7% of American families are unbanked and 20% are underbanked, according to the FDIC. 57.4% of unbanked respondants say that one reason for being unbanked is that they do not have enough money to keep in an account. Other reasons given include privacy, not trusting the banks, and account fees being too high or unpredictable.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/b/?node=14583169011&amp;amp;sa-no-redirect=1&quot;&gt;Amazon, recognizing that being unable to access credit/debit cards to use their service is a problem, is starting a new service to convert Cash to Amazon currency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Whenever I have to help anybody with programming, or look up something on their Macbook, it’s always bewildering: will they scroll in the same direction as I do? Did they set up hot corners? Are their desktops and docks messes, with programs littered throughout them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s made me think that the way people keep their computers may be reflective of their personalities in some way. I anal-retentatively keep my desktop and folders emptied and organized. My dock only has three items on it at any given time. So for this week’s EROFT assignment, to divine based on some ‘natural’ digital event, I decided to read a person’s personality based on how they’ve kept their Downloads folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/futurefinder1.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;futurefinder1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I wanted to divine a person’s future, MASH-style. It’s one of my favourite childhood interpretations of -omancy, but after I implemented it, it didn’t feel quite right. I decided that the key element of MASH was actually the interpersonal connection, making the lists of homes with your friends, listing out people you know to marry. Consequentially, I backed off of MASH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/futurefinder2.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;futurefinder2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then iterated around various facets of personality, but settled on determining a person’s MBTI type from a folder you can give it. I’m not a big fan of MBTI– I think that it’s largely been discounted by personality psychologists, and that the Big 5 types are more intuitive and less changeable. Additionally, most people don’t take the official MBTI test, so the results that they get are quite suspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequentially, my extremely inaccurate type test is probably as accurate as the typical MBTI test that someone would take online. It’s entirely based on the number of files in the given folder: if someone has many folders, maybe they’re more extroverted. If they have more images, they’re more sensing than intuitive. If they have a lot of files, perhaps they’re more thinking than feeling. If their oldest file is quite old, maybe they’re more judging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sorted.forEach( function(v) {
  var fileType = v.name.split('.').pop();
  if (fileType == 'png' || fileType == 'jpg' || fileType == 'jpeg' || fileType == 'gif' || fileType == 'bmp' || fileType == 'tiff')
    numImages++;
  if (v.name.split('.').length == 1)
    numFolders++;
  numFiles++;
});

var intro = (numFolders / numFiles) &amp;lt; 0.2;
var sensing = (numImages / numFiles) &amp;gt; 0.4;
var thinking = numFiles &amp;gt; 200;
var judging = Math.abs(new Date() - new Date(sorted[0].lastModified)) &amp;gt; 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
var type = intro ? &quot;I&quot; : &quot;E&quot;;
type += sensing ? &quot;S&quot; : &quot;N&quot;;
type += thinking ? &quot;T&quot; : &quot;F&quot;;
type += judging ? &quot;J&quot; : &quot;P&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, quite clearly, all nonsense. But isn’t it all nonsense anyways?&lt;/p&gt;

Having long been a Bitcoin skeptic (the price going up does little to convince me) and unsure of what innovations one should try ahead of more data from GiveDirectly, I still gave researching the topic a great deal of effort. Still, though, listening to hours of podcasts and reading many articles did little to inspire me on the subject. When we convened our meeting on Monday, my group had very little direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many suggestions were made. I suggested encouraging the death of the dowry, but that was turned down as it’s more a cultural issue than financial. Shivanku wanted refugees to be able to access their money from their home countries, but I rejected this– from all my readings on refugees from Syria and Yemen and other similar crises, these refugees either already have means of cash transfer or don’t have any money to transfer. Ariana wondered how to integrate banking more into a person’s usual routine, or perhaps how to educate westerners on poverty in the third world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jaycee arrived later, we coalesced into two factions: Shivanku and Ariana wanted to research cash transfers, whereas Jaycee and I would look at financial education. This would be a closer topic to my menstruation. RIP. Period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What’s the big problem? Two billion people in the world are unbanked.
2) What’s a focus of that? We can look at the specific issue of financial education– people who are unbanked may not know why that is a problem.
3) What’s some fanciful future tech that could be applied? We can use gamification and SMS to teach bite sized lessons on financial literacy.
4) 3-5 research links:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Interpreting the cards and figuring out how it might be relevant to a friend’s life was challenging and interesting. My only problem with the reading was that I was so new to the practice: discerning the meaning of a card took a long time, as I had to crosscheck each card online to figure out the symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus my primary motivation with the assignment was to create a set of fortunetelling cards that I could intuitively read– a set of cards whose mythology I already knew. I’m also not religious and didn’t grow up with religion, so I didn’t seem to have very many options on that front. After giving it some more thought, though, I realized that there was a modern mythology that I knew very well: that of Marvel Comics. I’m a huge comic book geek, so if I picked up a “Deadpool” card to intuit the past, I’d instantly know what that meant. It’s also something fairly well known: most people have seen the Avengers, so it’s an easy way to collectively tell a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/eroft_cards/tarot.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;eroft_cards/tarot.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a set of cards primarily using the watercolour art of Kevin Wada, a watercolour covers artist who mostly works for Marvel and Image. I emailed him asking for permission, which is something he’d likely have replied to before he became a big-name cover artist. Consequentially, I don’t have his express permission, so I won’t include the PDF or high resolution versions of the cards– if you’d like a set, you’ll have to create your own. Or you can get a reading from me in person!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then determined a spread for the cards, the concept of which is that each card will be placed according to which villain they will fight, and each villain corresponds to a reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Skull&lt;/em&gt; : your past&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultron&lt;/em&gt; : your challenge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green Goblin&lt;/em&gt; : what is hidden&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Galactus&lt;/em&gt; : your environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Doom&lt;/em&gt; : your advice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt; : a possible outcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did readings for five people– two of those readings are included below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/eroft_cards/reading1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;eroft_cards/reading1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryan’s reading was my first, and a bit rougher than the others– he had to help me out quite a bit. Bucky represents a fractured identity, two paths one can go on. Phoenix is rebirth, obviously. Psylocke represents spirituality and a challenge of cultural identity: she was born in a British body, but was put into a Japanese woman’s body. Nick Fury represents working against a bureaucratic environment. Namor advises that you lead with confidence, and that you should not be afraid to seem arrogant. Rogue means you will learn from your peers, absorbing knowledge from many different sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/eroft_cards/reading2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;eroft_cards/reading2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marco’s reading was very different. His past is seen in the Punisher, which seems to mean there may have been a traumatic event– he should be careful that this doesn’t preoccupy him. His challenge is Falcon: he might be anxious that he is untalented, but he should be reassured that everyone else is as lost as him. His inner strength is what makes him special. Hidden forces is Ms. Marvel, who gains her strength not just from her powers, but also her family and friends. Thor is his environment: he should be wary of traditions, and not feel pressured to live up to others’ expectations. Nightcrawler is advice: do not be afraid to leave a situation you’re uncomfortable with, or say no to them. And finally, an outcome: with Captain America, justice can be attained.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rita Cheng</name><email>rita@ritacheng.com</email></author><category term="eroft" /><category term="electronic rituals" /><category term="electronic rituals oracles and fortune telling" /><category term="marvel" /><category term="kevin wada" /><summary>In our last class for Electronic Rituals, I read Tarot for the very first time– and discovered that it’s an activity that I very much enjoy.

Supposedly, we’re going to play an actual game with our players, but hopefully I will not play. I’m terrible and don’t particularly like the game– in terms of tabletop fictional sports, I prefer air hockey. (So Canadian of me!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_foosball/positions.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_foosball/positions.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be position 12 on these fictional teams. Go fighting Blues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_foosball/firewood.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_foosball/firewood.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saved my firewood from last week to use this week, a decision I was glad for when I saw my classmates scramble to glue plywood together. My firewood is very soft, but it seemed a solid decision when a few of their glued pieces fell apart on the lathe. I also had enough material to spare half of my wood for a jig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_foosball/jig.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_foosball/jig.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Nate and I worked together to produce this little jig. I took down the wood, but I got distracted and let the scraper go flying when Swapna walked into the shop. She made me take a break and took down more of it– accidentally rounding the part we wanted for the jig. Woops! Thank you, Swapna, though– it was very kind of her to force me off the lathe. I guess I was more shaken than I thought I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned many things in making the jig, including how to use the 4 jaw chuck and how to get the headstock pinned. There was a lot more mental math than I’d like this week– I think everyone had trouble trying to figure out how to get 90/180 degrees when they’re divided by 5!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_foosball/jigresult.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_foosball/jigresult.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the jig, along with the taken down firewood for my actual piece. Since the jig was narrower than expected, we put the other hole 90 degrees from the one visible here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_foosball/signuplist.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_foosball/signuplist.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday was the day I thought I’d finish off the assignment, but so did everyone else! Since you can’t book timeslots for the lathe, I made a little signup sheet– to the consternation of everyone on the list after #6… Sorry guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_foosball/ideas.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_foosball/ideas.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I waited for my turn, I came up with ideas of how to make my foosball player unique. Since I didn’t want my team to lose, I stayed away from the ideas that seemed unstable, and settled on the chess piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_foosball/finished.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_foosball/finished.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I actually turned, I thought I might do a knight instead of the Queen that I drew. To make a Queen’s crown seemed like a lot of whittling that I didn’t want to do. Here’s the piece after sanding on the lathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_foosball/foosball.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_foosball/foosball.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as I added details on the helmet, I kinda got disatisfied and sanded the whole thing down to a flat top. It’s now a castle! I tested the thing out on the actual foosball table (hanging out with the goalie here) and it looks pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_foosball/misaligned.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_foosball/misaligned.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I discovered that, though the hole goes straight through, it’s slightly misaligned from the other side. Here you can see where the hole should be through my misaligned hole. Fortunately, this gave me a reason to finally use my deburring tool– if I tried to just drill it, the bits slip to where the hole already exists. The deburring tool let me take off just the bottom left corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sub_foosball/final.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;sub_foosball/final.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little more drilling and deburring, it fits! Now I can let Monday come with no worries– my piece will fit into spot #12.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rita Cheng</name><email>rita@ritacheng.com</email></author><category term="subtraction" /><category term="turning" /><category term="lathe" /><summary>This week in Subtraction, we’re making foosball players on the wood lathe.

It’s facile, but that’s the conclusion I drew after a break in which I did a lot of readings on the subject. I knew that I wanted to work on a project that affected both where we live and more developing countries, and I knew that periods caused big problems for girls around the world– some girls will not go to school when it happens, and it’s incredibly hard for many to purchase and access menstruation products. That’s not to mention anyone with PCOS and other debilitating symptoms!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On homeless periods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/01/23/periods-an-extra-hardship-for-homeless-women.html&quot;&gt;Periods an extra hardship for homeless women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took a look at Whisper and Tumblr to see how actual teens and younger women talk about their periods, and it wasn’t actually too different from how people my age talk about it. There was certainly more embarrassment involved, but a lot of it was complaints about cramps, just like any woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy for me to endlessly research, but coming up with a project concept was significantly tougher. There are three main avenues that I can approach this problem from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Education. Although puberty and Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) is taught in most schools around the world, many women do not get taught about menstruation until after they get their first periods. How do we educate younger girls about this? How do we educate boys to be sensitive about this? And how do we correct misconceptions, or handle any other questions (like PCOS) that might not be addressed in their formal education?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access to MHM and hygiene. In many countries, pads are incredibly expensive and are not accessible to many girls and women. Additionally, it may be difficult to wash yourself of any stains and accidents, as well as get new clothes and underwear. Fresh water is not always accessible, and many places do not have bathrooms. Even in the US, it is difficult for poorer women and the homeless to get pads and tampons– you might have to choose between eating and MHM. How can we help the most vulnerable get access and feel clean and safe?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access to the above in emergency situations. If what I described wasn’t bad enough, imagine dealing with these things during a civil war or a natural disaster. How can you learn about periods if you live in a refugee camp? How can we keep hygiene a priority when you do not have clean water to access?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s​ difficult, but after giving it a lot of thought, I think it all cycles back to education. If we don’t educate people on the importance of MHM, then we will never create the circumstances in which access for all will be created, and in which MHM is given thought during emergency situations. It’s particularly important that we both keep in mind cultural sensitivities, and also educate all genders about the subject: many girls don’t go to school during their periods because they face ridicule from the boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project will take a three pronged approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advertising and educating the general public. It’s very taboo in most cultures to discuss periods, so it’s important that the discussion is brought to the open and the more general public. Periods are not a dirty word, and it shouldn’t be a secret that men don’t understand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private chat to answer particular questions about periods that might not be addressed in the usual education system. It’s an extremely popular misconception around the world that using tampons would mean you are no longer a virgin. Asking a male teacher about this, or even a female one, would be incredibly awkward. Mothers and friends might tell you the wrong information. We need a trusted resource that is accessible and respectful of girls’ questions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RapidSMS/UReport to identify information impoverished areas to correct MSM misconceptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/unicef_final/bom.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;unicef_final/bom.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/unicef_final/timeline.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;unicef_final/timeline.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a revolutionary approach, and may not be a “provocation” per se, but I think a devoted resource to the topic worldwide would be incredibly powerful. It’s also within the scope of accomplishment– no fantasy pad making devices or laws are needed. It can be done in partnership with governments and corporations. It’s within our grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
