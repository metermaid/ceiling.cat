What was a little tougher was thinking of another creative application. Should I work with the piezo again? Should I just fix up my previous project? Instead, I decided to play a little more with the servo motor. It’s not as interesting as the Mario music, but a little more interesting than rote labs, which I’ll cover first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rote labs: riveting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up: wiring two photoresistors into an Arduino, and then translating the input into tones for the piezo. This was very annoying to listen to, so I’ll spare you the video for it and instead just play you a pleasant melody:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oUr1l6a2cD8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I don’t have any force sensing resistors, I just made a keyboard with the same photoresistors. Laziness rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I hooked up a servo to a potentiometer. GIF created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught a cold over the weekend, so my mind’s been a little temperature focused. I’ve been meaning to remove my air conditioner from the window, but I should probably wait until I’m feeling less feeble. Unfortunately, that also means that I have to endure the cold air that the air conditioner is letting through. Exactly how cold is my room? How can I know in a temperature system that isn’t backwards? All the thermometers around me are Fahrenheit. (Sorry, Fahrenheit, but it’s true. You only make sense when measuring people.) I decided to make a little temperature gauge with my Arduino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set the high and low temperature of the gauge, I looked at the historical highs and lows of New York– it reached 38.6°C in 1966 and was -20°C in 1994. Consequentially, I decided on setting the range at -20 to 40°C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/temperaturecode.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;temperaturecode.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create the gauge, I used the Arduino to set the servo to 0, drew a notch, set the servo to 179, drew a notch, and then drew notches in between. It’s super jaggy, so I should probably consider using capacitors to smooth it out. It’s probably not the most accurate temperature gauge either, but it’s enough to confirm for me: my room is too cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/temperaturegauge.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;temperaturegauge.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I’m less sick, I’ll get that A/C out of the window. For now, jumper wires are as much as I’ll lift.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rita Cheng</name><email>rita@ritacheng.com</email></author><category term="itp" /><category term="pcomp" /><category term="physical computing" /><summary>Since I had already worked with the piezo speaker last week, the labs this week for physical computing were a breeze.

If I close my eyes and imagine a scene from my life, the colours that are prominent are very different from the ones that I see on a day to day basis. But I haven’t lived in New York for very long; once my memories of Vancouver start to fade, the colours of that city will fade to the concrete and brick that surrounds me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of what we see is constructed, and the construction materials of these cities are often different. New York is a much older city than my hometown, and the buildings reflect the styles of the time. Apartments are also more common here; wooden houses are seen less often. Vancouver is noted, and immortalized by the author Douglas Coupland, as a city of glass; New York, despite its skyscraper reputation, has less glass in its construction. It’s not just because I live in Brooklyn and go to school in the village– even in the Financial District and Midtown, the city is less dominated by glass and steel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently: when I close my eyes, I imagine wooden houses painted in many colours or barely stained, cherry blossom trees lining every street, the greenest grass and flowering bushes, and blue green skyscrapers. This does not reflect my current reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took some pictures over a day to capture the background colours of my current reality. I thankfully have wooden floors at home and ITP, so I do have a break from the greys and pale blues of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/vl_colour/contact.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;vl_colour/contact.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also then applied a mosaic filter to this thumbnail sheet, to get a better sense of the average colours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/vl_colour/contact-m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;vl_colour/contact-m.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue, black, white, grey, beige. It’s a very common palette here, and, honestly, they’re the colours that dominate my wardrobe. Maybe I belong here more than Vancouver; I’ve never been in touch with nature and I have been always fond of muted colour schemes. They’re calm, as I would like to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few outlier colours here, but some are more notable than others. The purple lighting in one of these photos scream, but that’s just for that plant and not usually on. I don’t think it really reflects my life, particular since it’s not my plant. I also wear a lot of burgundy and that is not included here. It’s rich, but not too loud. I think this does reflect my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cap this off, I’ve created an image to capture the colours of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/vl_colour/voxel.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;vl_colour/voxel.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.s. I also took the colour hue test, and here are my results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;always-save-your-work&quot;&gt;Always save your work.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a lesson I had always known, but today I will amend it with some secondary lessons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A sketch in Arduino is a temporary file and is not saved, no matter how many times you hit CMD+S.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you close the Arduino app, say, to load a new library, this temporary file will be deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save your sketch in a new file lest it be deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are things I wish I had known this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. In case I forget to ask: my question for next week is whether there is an OSX oscilloscope app? If we’re connecting our Arduino for the computer anyways, using a separate device seems a bit redundant unless you need high precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;labs&quot;&gt;Labs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get to the story implied in the above lessons, I’ll cover the labs that I did to prepare for my heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was connect a button as a digital input, and then I printed to serial to see if it was pressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/digitalin_lab.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;digitalin_lab.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then connected some LEDs to the same circuit as digital outputs, essentially making the same circuits we did last week, but with the Arduino as middleware in between this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//giphy.com/embed/obDJLEKVogZ6U&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I connected an actuator to serve as an analog input to turn on an LED, which makes for a bit of a dull video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//giphy.com/embed/3CBoHiPOfavuw&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heartbreak&quot;&gt;Heartbreak&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then started working on my project for the week, where I learned some valuable lessons about saving your work. I had the bright idea of a Mario simulator. I hooked up a piezo speaker and a photo resister to my Arduino, with the following idea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the photo resister is uncovered or it’s light out, play the regular Mario theme.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if the photo resister is covered or it’s dark out, play the underground Mario theme.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if you transition between either of these states, play the Mario pipe noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a bit of time, but I more or less got this working. I put in some delays for debugging, and then had the bright idea to use the TimedAction library. A problem I was having was that each song had to finish playing before I switched states, so I thought TimedAction would help with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I closed the Arduino app to install TimedAction. I reopened it to see that my program was gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, i hadn’t reset the Arduino itself, so the app sort of still worked on the board itself– though it is marred with delays for debugging. So I do have video evidence of my handiwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, without the source code, I would need to rewrite it completely to refine the code, or to at least remove the delays. I assume the board only stores a compiled version, so to try and retrieve it from there would require decompilation and a bit of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, you can enjoy this video. And until I reset the board, one could also enjoy little Mario tunes on it in person as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Only after thinking about the routine do I remember “Free Falling” or “American Girl” or the Travelling Wilburys. Consequentially, both the Tom Petty fans and the Cliff Richard fans described in “Tom Petty: Temperance and religiosity in a non-marginal, non-stigmatized brand community” (Schau, Muniz Jr) and “Imprinting, Incubation and Intensification: Factors Contributing to Fan Club Formation and Continuance” (Henry, Caldwell) were utterly foreign to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PQ4o1N4ksyQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that occurred to me while reading, with this standup piece in mind, was that perhaps the fan activities we learned in class were not wholly sufficient: is it not a unique fan activity to learn as much as you can about an artist? (Or, in the parlance of that standup bit, remember where Tom Petty is from?) The Tom Petty fans make this fan activity explicit with a list of “10 Things Every TPATH fan knows” (Schau, 158) but this is classified by the author under a ‘ritual’. I’m not sure this knowledge gaining is necessarily ritualized in most fandoms, though, but it seems to me to be a form of fan activity. Nowadays, with the Internet in our lives, it’s not necessary to remember anything about your fandom– it’s easy to look any bit of trivia up. I can easily identify a hardcore fan by their memorization of these inconsequential facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I once wondered how wizards in Harry Potter learned foreign languages, and asked two of my fan friends. Within minutes, they reported that this was not addressed in canon, but that no spell for translation existed, citing the Goblet of Fire chapters during the Wizarding World Cup. I don’t think any lesser fan could’ve answered this query so thoroughly.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that struck me about these readings was that I don’t think I’ve been as big of a fan of anything as the fans of Richard and Petty are in these articles. I haven’t really made friends because of a particular fandom; I’ve only deepened pre-existing friendships by bonding over them. This is true despite how I used to work for anime conventions and was the anime club president during high school. During conventions and meetings I would only hang out with friends I’d already known,  and honestly, being a part of them made me a bit sick of anime in general. (I quit watching it abruptly when high school ended.) But Cliff Richard fans, in particular, forged new friendships because of Richard– it was rather cute when a fan answered what life would be like without Cliff with the immediate response, “we would not have met.” (Henry, 171).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve felt like a fan of things for a long time, but I don’t think I’ve really felt a sense of belonging or partook in traditions and obligations. Have I been a fan without being part of a fan group? I suppose the anime club did not count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is because I haven’t experienced a “bolt of lightning” imprinting of fandom as described in class. I’ve mostly fallen into fandoms very casually– my friends would’ve read or experienced something, and I’d join in. I’d watch a TV show because it was on when I got home from school, and then become a fan as I watched more regularly. For any given fandom I identify myself as a part of, I don’t think I can recall the moment when I became a fan. Perhaps I’m permanently stuck in the ‘incubation’ stage of most of my fandoms, but I do know that fangroups exist for them– I just have little interest in devoting the time in finding them and maintaining those relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things I didn’t identify with in these articles are the parasocial relationships and admiring a celebrity for having characteristics I desire for myself. I’m areligious and don’t admire any celebrities in particular. I suppose they offer me nothing in terms of personality traits I admire. For fandoms that are media properties, it makes more sense to me– I gravitate towards coming of age stories and stories that involve “special” outcasts (see: X-Men and Harry Potter fandoms.) It’s a common fixation, almost the entirety of the young adult fiction genre, as well as the collective works of Ayn Rand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I don’t participate in fan communities myself, I do have a good number of friends who do participate in fandom– two of my friends, as I mentioned, are hardcore Harry Potter fans and run a Harry Potter roleplaying blog. It’s been interesting to observe, and I do think the patterns mentioned in these pieces have largely been followed by them. Their ability to quote J.K. Rowling seems pseudo-religious, and they’ve been on legitimate Harry Potter pilgrimages: they’ve been to fan conventions to meet the actors of the films; they’ve seen Rowling at readings; they’ve been to Universal Studios for the Harry Potter ride. One of them even flew to Florida just to go to LeakyCon, a Harry Potter fan convention, and attributes Potter for getting her through high school bullying (even though the stigma may have contributed to the bullying? It’s tough to say.) That sounds like a pseudo-religious tale of the miraculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I don’t think I’ve been a part of a fan community, it’s been interesting being adjacent to fans who inarguably are. Also: I at least know where Tom Petty is from.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rita Cheng</name><email>rita@ritacheng.com</email></author><category term="itp" /><category term="fandom" /><summary>When I hear the name “Tom Petty”, the first thing I think of is an old standup routine about Google that my old roommates used to repeat.

We had to pick one used by the public, but try not to be seen observing them. Pick one that you can wait around near without being conspicuous. Pick one that you could hopefully take pictures of without seeming like you’re casing the store or establishment. This last criterion was the hardest. It ruled out most stores’ checkout machines, Amazon lockers, and other kiosks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also didn’t want to choose any interactive art piece, since there isn’t necessarily a “correct” or expected way to use one of those. After realizing that most NYPL branches are closed on Sundays– my first choice were self-checkout machines for books– I pretended to wait for a friend at the Regal Cinemas Union Square. You could wait a while around the lobby in theatres for a while– waiting for a friend who will never arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been to a movie theatre in the US, but I’ve been to a great deal of them in Canada. I assumed that movie habits were largely the same between our two countries. In Canada, most people pick a movie they want to see, arrive around 30-10 minutes before the film, and then buy tickets at a self-serve kiosk. People weren’t entirely behaving as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caveats: I was at a Regal theatre, which isn’t the dominant theatre chain in New York as far as I can tell. This was a Sunday afternoon, so there were fewer people than on a Friday evening and had different demographics than the popular nights. There were fewer young people at the theatre, and more middle-aged couples.  There were also two guys sitting at a table near the self-checkout machines trying to survey people about Con Edison– a deterrent to using the machines if I’ve ever seen one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/observation/movie1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;These dudes were persistent.&quot; alt=&quot;observation/movie1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, despite these factors, I still believe that theatre goers in Canada would behave differently. First of all, although both American and Canadian chains let you buy tickets in advance, many more Canadians use the feature to print the ticket at the theatre– so much so that Canadian theatres have standalone pickup-only kiosks. Nobody here, as far as I could tell, printed tickets to pickup. If they bought in advance, I assume they printed it out or had them on their phones, as they went straight up the escalators. Additionally, Canadians are much more likely to use the self-service machines entirely– many people (perhaps around 50-60%) from my observations forgo the machines to use the box office. Canadians would use self-service sometimes even if there was no line. Finally, a few of the people I observed engaged in behaviour i rarely saw in Canada– they went to the theatre without having a movie in mind. Before approaching the machine, they stared at the ticker of screenings overhead, and discussed what movie they might want to see. This behaviour seems to be less and less common over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone who used the machines seemed experienced with using them. There was no particular demographic that indicated whether one would use the machine or not– young and old, female and male, and couples and singles both used the box office and ticketing machines in equal quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The machines in its usage were entirely similar to Canadian ticketing kiosks, on the other hand. The starting screen gives you four options: purchase a ticket for today, purchase one for the future, access your rewards account, and pickup tickets that were purchased in advance. Everyone who I observed over 20 minutes picked the first option, which then took them to a screen to select a movie, and then a time, and then the number of tickets. You would then optionally select concessions to purchase (which nobody opted for, similar to Canadians. Nobody wants to buy food without seeing it in front of them, particularly since it’s not discounted for buying here.) and finally, pay for their tickets. Overall, each of these transactions took 30 seconds to one minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/observation/movie2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;observation/movie2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, besides the aforementioned differences from Canada (box office vs ticketing machine, picking a movie in advance vs picking it at the theatre, picking up tickets vs printing them out at home) most people did not deviate from the process detailed above. During this process, payment seemed to take the longest– this makes sense, as the machines only take credit and debit cards and therefore require a connection to outside banking services. Beyond this, from the user standpoint, what took the longest was sometimes finding the button in the initial screen– users would be aided if the option to buy tickets today was more prominent, as it is unlikely that a user would pick a different option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest parts seem to be locating their movie and skipping concession movies. The former is easy because it’s visual and sorted– you’re likely to recognize the movie poster, and you can figure out where it fits in alphabetical order. The latter is easy because the skip purchase button is located in the same place as the button to confirm your number of tickets in the previous screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of these machines seem to be easy, though, only because the process is simple and the users seem to have used them before. They don’t do particularly well when judged by Crawford’s definition of interactivity, as they don’t give very much feedback for your actions and don’t seem to “think” about your choices. If you select something incorrectly, you don’t get confirmation until the end. The self-serve kiosks were also set apart from the box office line (most of the time in Canada, the kiosks are in the same space as the box office line) so they don’t do well by Norman’s principles of signifiers–people would go into the box office line because cultural signifiers indicate that the line is the way to purchase a ticket, and not the isolated area adjacent to it (with the kiosks.) The icons of the main screen are also fairly nonsensical, and I wouldn’t be able to distinguish purchasing a ticket and picking one up without the labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addendum-1&quot;&gt;Addendum 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was at the movie theatre, a dude taught me how to sneak into the movie theatre by bypassing some technology. You get someone who paid for a ticket to call the elevator from upstairs, and sneak into the elevator as it’s going up. He was also hitting on me– and everyone knows that a man who refuses to pay for a movie ticket is very alluring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addendum-2&quot;&gt;Addendum 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also read the introduction and first chapter of &lt;em&gt;Disability and Design&lt;/em&gt;. This was fascinating, and gave me a lot to think about. It reminded me of a few pieces of design for disability that I’ve seen recently: for instance, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/metal-gear-solid-prosthetics-arm-amputee-james-young-hi-tech-synthetic-limb-a6887071.html&quot;&gt;Metal Gear Solid prosthetic that a UK man received earlier in the year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s always seemed absurd to me how much design for disability is meant to conceal and blend in, especially when contrasted with the futures we imagine in science fiction in which robots and cyborgs are celebrated and artistic. I imagine a future with 3D printing more readily available to the public in which people could print bespoke versions of the prosthetics they want. Everybody is different, and we shouldn’t assume they all want to hide their disability– but if you do, you should be able to have that option as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rita Cheng</name><email>rita@ritacheng.com</email></author><category term="itp" /><category term="physical computing" /><category term="pcomp" /><summary>I had a bit of trouble deciding on what piece of interactive technology to observe for this blog post.

It ruled out most stores’ checkout machines, Amazon lockers, and other kiosks.</summary></entry><entry><title>Typefaces</title><link href="http://www.ceiling.cat/2016/09/24/typefaces/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Typefaces" /><published>2016-09-24T05:01:35-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-24T05:01:35-04:00</updated><id>http://www.ceiling.cat/2016/09/24/typefaces</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.ceiling.cat/2016/09/24/typefaces/">&lt;p&gt;For visual language, I had to pick six typefaces to represent me.

Although I have many friends who are Trekkies, I’ve never been one for the series myself. I’ve seen two of the new movies (and don’t like them very much) and a handful of episodes from the Next Generation, but to call me a fan would be a stretch. I’m reasonably capable of pretending to be a fan– Presto accused me of being one after I recognized a Tribble– but genuine fandom is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new TV series coming out, though, I’m somewhat interested in being a fan– Bryan Fuller will be the showrunner, and I’m a big fan of his work. I thought it would be a good time to immerse myself in some Trek fandom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Paley Center’s celebration encompassed more or less every type of fan activity, but we would take part of only a few. The bulk of the exhibit revolved around content making: the Paley had 50 pieces of fan art on display on the first floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/startrek/exhibit.jpg&quot; height=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;5312&quot; alt=&quot;startrek/exhibit.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids who visit the Paley could take part in Star Trek related arts and crafts: we walked by some kids creating Trek hand puppets out of paper bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/startrek/paperbags1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;startrek/paperbags1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Paley also had some evangelization events: not necessarily of Trek specifically– being a fan of Trek is almost assumed of its visitors– but we narrowly missed a roundtable discussion of which Trek captain is the best. That’s classic fan evangelization for each Trek captain. Although no rituals were created at the exhibit– as far as I knew– rituals were sustained during it, including the classic greetings of the Vulcan salute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Paley, as any museum would, also had a Trek-related gift shop. Presto and I failed to buy anything. No performative consumption was done; no posters were signed by the artists present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than anything else, though, the Paley exhibition was a pilgrimage, and a pilgrimage we went on. We have the pictures and video to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5NP51vBiyHk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is apparently a boomarang. I don’t understand apps nowadays.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing all of the fan art in general did not trigger very many fan feelings in itself– I didn’t think that Trek fandom was a utopia, nor did I feel belonging. I sensed a bit of social hierarchy within the fan group: fans who could produce such art are at the top of the social chain and I, mere mortal, appear below them. Observing the credit panels for the fan art triggered a different feeling though: the classic Trek feelings of utopia came about, because the fan artists came from all sorts of backgrounds and from everywhere in the world. Anybody could be a Trekkie, and they could all belong in this gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/startrek/coolspock.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;startrek/coolspock.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t feel belonging though, so I tried to engage in a bit of socialization by talking to people in the gallery about some of the art (as well as Patrick, but since we were both outside observers it didn’t feel like a fan interaction.) What did people think of the art? Could they please explain this cryptic art to me? Nobody was able to explain the vulcan head giving birth to a baby vulcan to me (I unfortunately neglected to take pictures of this), so I didn’t feel fanlike feelings about this socialization. Just discomfort about a fan culture that could produce such art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the kids making their paper bag puppets felt like a utopia again. There was a lot of mixed feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick and I then attended a session to teach the audience how to speak Klingon– engaging in a mass attempt at impersonation. A speaker from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kli.org/&quot;&gt;Klingon Language Institute&lt;/a&gt;, Elizabeth Lawrence Faber, handed out pamphlets on Klingon grammar and taught us some of the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/startrek/klingon.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;startrek/klingon.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried earnestly to pronounce some of the words, but couldn’t produce the guttural noises despite my efforts. I honestly felt like I didn’t belong: people, including a particularly clever little boy, would ask insightful questions about Klingon and Trek that wouldn’t have occurred to me to ask. They’d pronounce things better than I could, and overall seemed more engaged– Patrick and I were both falling asleep during parts of the session. Plus, the introductory video was far from utopic nor welcoming: it was footage of Klingons spying on the Federation, and doing ill (as far as I could tell.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, at the end of the session, I felt the social stigma deeply: our instructor ended by trying to lead us in singing a Klingon lullaby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8UzuZxh1caM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was awkward. Nobody else was confident enough in their Klingon to try it, and she wasn’t singing on tune. Ending with this session left my visit on a sour note: I thought Trek was sorta cool during the fanart, but the Klingon lesson just reminded me of the time and effort that I could not see myself devoting to the fandom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/startrek/cereal.jpg&quot; height=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;The cereal was cool, though.&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;startrek/cereal.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hiroshima, Mon Amour&lt;/em&gt; was a 1959 French film directed by Alain Resnais. It’s one of my favourite films, and highly influential in world cinema: it influenced the later French New Wave with its nonlinear storyline and its innovative use of flashbacks. Moreover, it’s just a lovely film about the shortcomings of memories and dealing with personal– and not personal– tragedy. The original poster was designed by Boris Grisson, a prolific Russian-French designer who designed over 2000 French film posters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;colour&quot;&gt;Colour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hiroshima/colour1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;hiroshima/colour1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grisson’s posters were designed to be printed as lithographs, a printing technique in which the artist etches several stone blocks (using oils) and then flat colour is applied to the block, which is then used to produce a print on paper. Each colour would have its own stone block (or else would be applied by hand); consequentially, many lithographs have limited colour palettes. This poster is no exception to this. Although I have highlighted five separate colours here, it is more likely that only two or three inks were applied to this lithograph: a red, a black, and perhaps a soft peach (the brown is likely produced by combining the red and black.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall colour scheme is soft and evokes melancholy; a perfect fit for a film about memory. The red invokes passion and the idea of love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hiroshima/colour2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;hiroshima/colour2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This poster is also effectively produced using cheaper printing techniques; here, the print is cheaply created using only two types of ink: red and black. This variation is effective in its own way: the strong red on the white paper looks like the Japanese flag, and also looks like a splash of blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;typefaces&quot;&gt;Typefaces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hiroshima/typefaces.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;hiroshima/typefaces.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This poster was created before even phototypesetting was popular, so the letterforms aren’t very consistent– it’s hard to identify what precise typefaces are used here. The type was likely traced, cut out, or stamped by hand. What is clear is that there are two typefaces used: a slab serif for the title, and a geometric sans-serif for all the other copy. The first is used sparingly, with only one bold-weight variation. The latter appears as both medium and bold weight and in condensed and regular forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;Grid&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hiroshima/grid.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;hiroshima/grid.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, a grid was likely not used in the design of this poster. The main image is painted, and there isn’t a lot of typography; the grid was primarily used at the time for things with more copy or from stricter schools of graphic design. That isn’t to say there isn’t alignment and order in the image; the title was likely aligned with the back of the man’s head and the top of his pants; the addition of the top left box (that proclaims the film a two-time winner at Cannes) is aligned with his hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hiroshima/ruleofthirds.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;hiroshima/ruleofthirds.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule of thirds applies, more or less, though. The woman’s face and the title are placed at thirds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visual-hierarchy-and-whitespace&quot;&gt;Visual Hierarchy and Whitespace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hiroshima/arrows.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;hiroshima/arrows.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The red splash in the background directs the eye. Without it, it would be harder to determine the positive space’s visual hierarchy; the whitespace is otherwise a bit formless. The splash directs you from the top left corner to the couple at the center and then finally, the movie’s title and the credits copy. A separate hierarchy occurs with the woman’s gaze and the award-touting box. You start at her gaze, and it drives you towards the left and the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the poster creates a compelling story of Japan, melancholy, and a hesitant couple. I think it’s fairly effective design.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rita Cheng</name><email>rita@ritacheng.com</email></author><category term="itp" /><category term="visual language" /><summary></summary></entry><entry><title>Interactivity</title><link href="http://www.ceiling.cat/2016/09/13/interactivity/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Interactivity" /><published>2016-09-13T00:01:35-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-13T00:01:35-04:00</updated><id>http://www.ceiling.cat/2016/09/13/interactivity</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.ceiling.cat/2016/09/13/interactivity/">&lt;p&gt;Comic books, for the most part, are not interactive mediums. Usually, reading them is just a series of one-sided actions and reactions: you read a comic book, and you respond emotionally to its static contents. The comic remains unmoved by your actions; it never responds to anything in your circumstance. There are occasional exceptions to this, however: if you send the publisher fan mail, and it is published, that may arguably be an interaction. You read the comic, respond with mail, and the writer or editor publishes your letter and a response. Of course, this doesn’t actually effect the body of the comic, only the back pages and extras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more concrete example of interactivity occurs when a comic writer designs their story around it: famously in 1988, Jason Todd, the Robin at the time to Batman, was put in a life-or-death situation, and DC decided to leave his fate up to a fan vote. You would call one number to save his life; call the other to let the Joker kill him. DC had expected fans to save Jason. They’d planned more stories around him, and didn’t imagine that fans could be so cold-blooded. Instead, the fans narrowly decided to let him die, and the publisher decided to go through with the fans’ decision. They couldn’t use their planned stories, and this death had negative repercussions to the Batman character and comic for years thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You read the comic book, you voted, and the comic’s story changed based on the results of that vote. That’s an interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More precisely, interaction is a back and forth between two or more things, or, in the words of Chris Crawford, “a cyclic process in which two actors alternately listen, think, and speak.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Interactivity can then be subdivided into digital and physical interactions. But where do we draw the line between these two categories? What is physical interaction? Where should we put edge cases, like augmented realities and check-in spaces?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, there isn’t a need to make these kinds of interactions a strict categorization. Things can exist on a continuum: digital, physical, or somewhere in between. Interactions are more digital when they primarily involve objects that are intangible; they are more physical when they have physical or tactile components. Using a theremin is more of a digital phenomena than playing an electric guitar, but they are both electronic instruments. Both are considerably more physical than playing music on a digital soundboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is somewhat akin to how Crawford asserts that interaction itself can be measured in degrees and on a continuum.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Everything is shades of grey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good interaction can be found when the interaction uses intuitive controls and gives you proper feedback for your actions. This may mean the affordances are natural to what a user already knows: for instance, a Wacom pen tablet’s controls are in line with how people use non-digital writing utensils. You press down for more pressure; write at an angle to change the shape of your line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a design can be successful even if it is completely out of sync with what one knows: returning to the theremin, the control scheme is completely out of line with what a typical person knows about playing music. However, the music sounds completely otherworldly, so the otherworldly control scheme is in line with expectations. Additionally, feedback is real time and can be instantly be heard, it is still successful at helping people play music.  It may be poor interaction, on some level, but a good design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, good design makes good use of affordances, but they are not interactive and give no feedback. A good example of this are real-time bus and subway countdown estimates. You don’t interact with them in any way; your actions do not affect the subway countdown. However, they’re great design by using your pre-existing expectations about subway timetables and signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the theremin, many designers today excel at the feedback portion, but fail at using existing affordances. In a long rant&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Bret Victor rails against the vision of the future that is screen-based– this fails to make use of thousands of years of developing physical affordances. An ideal interaction makes use of both existing affordances and also delivers feedback for your actions.&lt;/p&gt;

Usually, reading them is just a series of one-sided actions and reactions: you read a comic book, and you respond emotionally to its static contents. The comic remains unmoved by your actions; it never responds to anything in your circumstance. There are occasional exceptions to this, however: if you send the publisher fan mail, and it is published, that may arguably be an interaction. You read the comic, respond with mail, and the writer or editor publishes your letter and a response. Of course, this doesn’t actually effect the body of the comic, only the back pages and extras.</summary></entry></feed>
