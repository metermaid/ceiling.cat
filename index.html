		<h1><a href="/blog/2014/01/02/resolutions/">Resolutions</a></h1>
		<time>02 January 2014</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>It&rsquo;s that time of year when everybody is making resolutions to improve themselves: the start of a new year, the thinking goes, is auspicious for new beginnings, and plus, everybody else is doing it. I&rsquo;ve been asked a dozen times whether I had any New Year&rsquo;s resolutions, and I usually answer with a poor joke: I resolve not to make New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions. In all honesty, I&rsquo;ll probably just continue with these resolutions I made at arbitrary times of last year:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drink more water. I think a lot of people know I&rsquo;m in a state of constant dehydration; my chapped lips don&rsquo;t appreciate the snide comments, Certain Former Coworker Who Should Really Mind His Own Business. The thinking is that being properly hydrated will have a cascade of positive health benefits: I&rsquo;ll feel better, have better skin, and have more energy. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s true, and I know I&rsquo;ll miss the one positive benefit of not being hydrated: I never need bathroom breaks and am a champ at watching movie marathons in a single sitting.</li>
<li>I will not go see live shows of bands with four or more members who are <em>only</em> white dudes. Over the past year, I&rsquo;ve been increasingly concerned with ideas of diversity and representation. I may not have very many options in TV and movies, (there are only so many quality shows out there),but I can at least try to encourage more diversity in my listening habits (since black people are at the root of most of the genres we listen to, this shouldn&rsquo;t be as hard.) Moreover, you would think after your third member, you could at least find one person who isn&rsquo;t male or exclusively white. It shouldn&rsquo;t be a difficult proposition.</li>
<li>Exercise more regularly. Journal more regularly. Meditate more regularly. These are pretty usual resolutions that I began using Beeminder for last year.</li>
</ol>


<p>With that said, I do have one new resolution for the new year:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stop lying to Beeminder about all of the water drinking/working out/meditating you haven&rsquo;t been doing.</li>
</ol>


<p>We&rsquo;ll see how these resolutions work out. Since I started them at an arbitrary time, I can always start them later if I fail. With the advent of the year of the Horse (my astrological sign), if I believed in astrology, the whole year is an auspicious time to start a new resolution.</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/12/19/a-new-start/">A New Start</a></h1>
		<time>19 December 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>As part of a discussion on the future of journalism, Jason Kottke, prominent blogger, recently blogged about <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/12/the-blog-is-dead/">the end of the blog</a>. The supposition is that social media forms are taking over the function of the blog, and that the stream&mdash; reverse chronological ordering at the heart of blogs&mdash; is falling out of prominence compared to algorithmically-determined importance. If this is true, it&rsquo;s a bit of an odd time for me to try and revive my blog (after numerous format changes, this attempt is using Octopress.) However, I think the article&rsquo;s premises are a bit dubious, and now is as good a time as ever (for me) to be blogging.</p>

<p>The article posits that the stream is on the wane, but I disagree: the sites he cites are generally either two-way communication tools (which were never too blog-like, like Snapchat or Facebook) or still presented in chronological order (Pinterest and the other grids, Twitter, and Buzzfeed.) In any case, chronology still plays an important part of the importance algorithms mentioned (Reddit, Facebook). What marks a new trend in blog-like media is not the death of the stream, but the rise of personal curation: increasingly the blogs and news we follow are personally curated by our friends (linked on Facebook; reblogged on Tumblr; retweeted or posted on Twitter) or by authorities (Medium, Longreads). Buzzfeed editors personally sort through and regurgitate content found elsewhere. And this content often comes from blogs. The blog isn&rsquo;t dying, but the blogroll and other traditional means of promoting blogs are.</p>

<p>If blogs are dying, then why are there so many simple blog startups? Medium comes from one of the social networks supposedly disrupting blogs, and Ghost raised over $200,000 towards their definitely-a-blog platform. As long as you have thoughts and would like them to be published online, as I do, now is a good a time as ever to start blogging.</p>
