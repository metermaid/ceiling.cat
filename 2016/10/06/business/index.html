  <p>I have three confessions to make, dear blog readers, about my Visual Language assignment. The first is that the night before it was assigned, I essentially finished it. I wasn’t aware it would be assigned the next day; I just thought that I should make myself business cards. The second is that I just made some quick edits to it to meet the assignment’s criteria for submission. I didn’t redo the assignment; it felt like a waste. The third confession: I don’t like the adjustments I made, and I wish I kept my original design before sending them to the printers.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>One of the most important factors in the design of my business cards was the redesign of my portfolio and blog. When I started ITP, I knew I would have to redesign both: I failed to update them in years, and class after class emphasized to me that the blog was a central part of ITP. I also wanted to move my blog to the ceiling.cat domain, a novelty domain that I’d owned for years but had done nothing with.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vl_business/ceilingcat.jpg" width="" height="" alt="vl_business/ceilingcat.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you were an internet nerd in the mid 2000s, you’d probably remember this meme.</p>

<p>Another thing I wanted was to have matching but separate identities for both websites. The portfolio was serious, and meant to showcase my best work; the blog was for works in progress and silly thoughts from ITP.</p>

<p>I also wanted the blog to have a logo with a cat. It didn’t make much sense to do otherwise.</p>

<p>To summarize: I wanted to have a logo template that would work for a serious portfolio as well as a cat. That’s a bit of a tough briefing, but it’s aided by how the original ceiling cat appears: he pops out of a square hole in the ceiling.</p>

<p>Consequentially, I can start with a square template for both logos– it’s clean and professional for my portfolio, and appropriate for ceiling cat.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vl_business/template.png" width="" height="" alt="vl_business/template.png" /></p>

<p>I decided that I wanted to subtly evoke stamps and Chinese seals– it’d reflect my heritage and help give the logos a unified idea. I rounded the corners and decided that the logos would be single colour, as if they could be stamped on. Then, I could convert them to black and white, any colours, or even add an image to the logo.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vl_business/seals.jpg" width="" height="" alt="vl_business/seals.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is getting a bit long-winded, so I’ll spare you more details about the logos. Suffice to say, I drew a bunch of cats, and tested a bunch of typefaces, and came out with the following two logos.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vl_business/logos.png" width="" height="" alt="vl_business/logos.png" /></p>

<h3 id="the-original-design">The Original Design</h3>

<p>With this starting point, I decided to make my business cards on Sunday. Given the ‘chinese seal’ design element, I decided to take scroll paintings as inspiration, and drew a digital watercolour painting of a bird on a cherry blossom tree. (My street in Vancouver was lined with cherry blossoms, as many are.)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vl_business/flowers.png" width="" height="" alt="vl_business/flowers.png" /></p>

<p>The painting’s focal is from right to left, as most Chinese scrolls are, and I consequentially placed my seal and my information on the left of the card.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vl_business/original.png" width="" height="" alt="vl_business/original.png" /></p>

<p>I finished at this point, and then the next day I went to class. I received the assignment, and changed things for the worse.</p>

<h3 id="the-redesign">The Redesign</h3>

<p>The most consequential change was that the assignment stipulated that the card had to be double sided. I originally tried making the painting go across the two sides, but the image was too low-resolution to print at this point.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vl_business/spread.png" width="" height="" alt="vl_business/spread.png" /></p>

<p>I then decided to stick with the image on one side, and just moved the information to the back. I also flipped the painting, because we discussed in class how the lower left corner was the weakest focal point of an image (which, in retrospect now, is less consequential in a landscape business card with its low height.)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vl_business/double.png" width="" height="" alt="vl_business/double.png" /></p>

<p>I sent this image to the printers, which I terribly regret. In retrospect, landscape business cards are too short for that focus information to matter, and images always look better before they’re flipped (unless they are perfectly symmetrical.)</p>

<p>Additionally, it’s overall a stronger design on only one side. I also regret the serif font I chose on the back– I thought it would provide a nice contrast, but it just looks out of place.</p>

<p>Overall, I wish I kept my original card. But you can keep this analysis in the meanwhile.</p>
